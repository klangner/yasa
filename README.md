# SDR applications based on FutureSDR

Applications:
* fmradio - Receiver for FM radio stations


## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you develop larger features or work on
major changes with the main intention to submit them upstream, it would be
great, if you could announce them in advance.

## Conduct

This project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc]. It describes
the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors.

[coc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## License

This project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license][lic].

Using this license is in contrast to the large majority of Open Source SDR
applications and frameworks, which are mostly AGLP, LGPL, or GPL. In a nutshell,
this means that there is *no* money to be made from relicensing the project for
commercial use, since this is already allowed by Apache 2.0. Furthermore,
companies can use (parts of) the project and integrate (adapted) versions in
commercial products without releasing the source or contributing back to the
project.

The main motivation for this license is that
* it better fits the Rust ecosystem
* it eases adoption; one can use (parts of) the code with close to no strings
  attached
* using Open Source and not contributing back (for the time being) seems better
  than not using Open Source at all

for inclusion in FutureSDR, shall be licensed as Apache 2.0, without any
additional terms or conditions.
